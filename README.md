# Github Action: Shopify Automated PR Theme Check Reporter

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**Action Repository:** `ShopLab-Team/shoplab-pr-shopify-theme-check-reporter@v2`

## What it does

This GitHub Action automatically runs Shopify Theme Check against your theme code within a Pull Request using the official `@shopify/theme-check-node` library. It then posts a formatted report as an **updating comment** directly on the PR, making it easy for developers to see errors and warnings without leaving the PR interface.

This action makes use of several key components:

1.  **`@shopify/theme-check-node`**: The official Node.js library from Shopify for running theme checks programmatically. [More Info](https://github.com/Shopify/theme-tools/tree/main/packages/theme-check-node)
2.  **`actions/checkout`**: Standard action to check out your repository code.
3.  **`actions/setup-node`**: Standard action to ensure the correct Node.js version is available on the runner.
4.  **`marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment`**: A helpful action used to post and update the report comment on the Pull Request. [More Info](https://github.com/marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment)

## Key Features

* Runs theme checks automatically on PRs (`opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`).
* Posts a clear summary comment to the PR (e.g., "X error(s), Y warning(s) found.").
* Groups findings by Errors (`üö®`) and Warnings (`‚ö†Ô∏è`) if both exist.
* Formats issues clearly with relative file paths, line/column numbers, messages, and check codes.
* Provides direct **clickable links** to the specific line of code on GitHub for easy navigation.
* Includes a link back to the full GitHub Actions run for detailed logs.
* **Updates the existing comment** on subsequent commits to the PR, avoiding comment spam.
* **Fails the workflow run** if errors are detected (useful for branch protection rules).
* Optionally fails the run if warnings are detected.

## How to use

Add a job to your existing Pull Request workflow (e.g., `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml`):
